# Welcome to BetterShop ![build status](https://ci.husk.pro/BetterShop/badge)

This is a rewrite of the original [Shop by Conjurate](https://github.com/Nowaha/Shop-by-Conjurate) with aim of extensibility, cleanliness and performance in mind!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Goals
- Simple to use
- Clean, fast code
- Near-full feature parity

The biggest issue with the previous plugin was the code was unmaintainable, making changes or debugging was unnecessarily difficult.

This is aimed to improve in all these aspects as well as provide greater functionality!
