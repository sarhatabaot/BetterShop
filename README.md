# Welcome to BetterShop ![build status](https://ci.husk.pro/BetterShop/badge)

This is a rewrite of the original [Shop by Conjurate](https://github.com/Nowaha/Shop-by-Conjurate) with a few goals in mind:

## üì• Download

While the project is still in it's early days, bleeding edge downloads are [available here](https://ci.husk.pro/)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Goals
- Clean code
- Fast code
- Full feature parity

The big issue with the previous plugin was the code was a nightmare to navigate, making changes or debugging was complete hell.

This is aimed to improve in all these aspects.
